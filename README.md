# TorrentChain üåê‚ö°

**A decentralized, efficient, and accessible blockchain inspired by the power of P2P networks.**

Welcome to the official repository of **TorrentChain**, an innovative project that combines the efficiency of the BitTorrent protocol with the security and decentralization of blockchain technology. Our goal is to create a truly democratic network where anyone can participate using common hardware like CPUs and hard drives.

## **Why TorrentChain?**

**TorrentChain** was created to address the main challenges of current blockchains:
- **High energy consumption**: We replace Proof of Work (PoW) with a **Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)** consensus mechanism, which directs computational power to solving useful problems, such as scientific data processing.
- **Mining centralization**: Our BitTorrent-inspired P2P architecture allows everyday users to participate in the network without the need for specialized hardware.
- **Scalability**: We use distributed storage for transactions, reducing the load on the main chain and increasing efficiency.

## **How Does It Work?**

### **1. Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)**
Instead of wasting energy on meaningless calculations, **TorrentChain** miners solve real-world computational problems, such as:
- Data processing for scientific projects.
- Training simple AI models.
- Mathematical and physical simulations.

### **2. Distributed Storage**
Transactions are split into small chunks and distributed across the network. Each node stores only a portion of the data but can access the rest of the network when needed.

### **3. Fair Rewards**
Participants are rewarded for:
- Solving useful tasks (PoUW).
- Storing and sharing transaction chunks.
- Validating blocks and maintaining network security.
